# WaxFrame Professional — Changelog

---

## v3.17.0 Pro — Build `20260419-010`
**Released:** April 19, 2026

### 4-Screen Setup Flow
Replaced the previous 2-screen setup (split-panel Setup + split-panel Project) with four dedicated full-width screens. Each screen has one job, its own header with hamburger menu and ← Back button, and a step badge.

| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Setup 1 — Worker Bees** | Save API keys for your AI reviewers |
| **Setup 2 — Builder** | Choose which AI rewrites the document each round |
| **Setup 3 — Your Project** | Name your project and define your goal |
| **Setup 4 — Starting Document** | Upload a file, paste text, or start from scratch |

### Structured Project Goal Fields
Replaced the single `projectGoal` textarea with six structured fields assembled into a prompt brief via `assembleProjectGoal()`. Fields: Document type *, Target audience *, Desired outcome *, Scope & constraints, Tone & voice, Additional instructions. Required fields marked with asterisks. Legacy `projectGoal` data migrates to Additional instructions on first load.

### Universal Card Layout
All four setup screens share a consistent centered card layout — `max-width: 1390px` — with gray space on the sides at larger viewports. Cards fill the available body height at all supported viewport sizes.

### Starting Document — Panel Improvements
Upload, Paste, and Scratch panels fill the card height on both laptop and desktop. Pulsing WaxFrame logo watermark restored and re-anchored to the active panel. Watermark animates on a 16s breathing cycle: 1s dark → 6s ease in → 2s full hold → 6s ease out → 1s dark. Logo renders at `300px` on desktop and `150px` on laptop.

### Navigation & Layout
- Hamburger menu and ← Back button on every setup screen header
- Nav panel Navigate section updated to 4 items (one per setup screen)
- `fs-header` and `fs-footer` backgrounds changed to `var(--surface)` with 2px border for visibility in light mode
- Minimum screen overlay fires at `≤ 1421px` width or `≤ 810px` height

### Project Goal Modal
Now read-only on the Work screen. Save & Close replaced with ✏️ Edit Goal which navigates directly to Setup 3.

### CSS Variable System
Font size scale added to `:root` — `--fs-xs` through `--fs-mono`.

### Bug Fixes
- Removed orphaned two-column project markup that caused 13 duplicate DOM IDs
- Fixed stale `max-width: 680px` rule on `fs-body-single` from old multi-selector
- Fixed watermark `::after` positioning — now anchors to active panel via `position: relative`
- Removed incorrect laptop overrides that expanded 80ch panels to full width

### Files Changed
